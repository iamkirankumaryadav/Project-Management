# **Project Management**

### Project Management Approaches

1. **Plan Driven Project Management**

- The most traditional method of managing projects.
- Sometimes referred to as Predictive – aims to plan as much of the scope, costs, schedules, and resources as early and as thoroughly as possible to minimize waste due to misalignment, uncertainty, rework and changes.
- Controlling expenditures, resource allocation and utilization, schedules and deadline, quality standards, and stakeholder requirements are critical to the success of the project. 
 
2. **Agile Project Management**

- Agile methodologies aim to embrace changes early and often in a project to reduce the impact of changes later.
- This is accomplished with shorter timeboxed cycles to produce work, gather feedback, and iterate based on feedback and learning.
- Allowing and encouraging change is crucial.
- Being transparent and honest enables teams to get more input on work in progress and ability to adjust quickly.
- Scope and outputs may shift, expand, and/or contract as the product evolves. 

3. **Second Agile Project Management** 

- Agile methods are best suited for smaller, more self-organizing teams.
- Self-contained teams allow more ability to inspect and adopt faster and with less overhead or dependencies.
- Nevertheless, as organizations grow and more teams require greater communication and collaboration to fulfill common goals and objectives, there must be frameworks in place to support larger coordinated efforts.
- Operating agile at a larger scale demands more visibility and synchronization.
- This includes within the near-term timeboxes as well as within longer-term initiatives.
- For instance, related teams or programs may allocate an entire sprint primarily for planning and coordination.
- This enables teams to better forecast what they may be doing or leading towards.
- But more importantly, it allows the teams to uncover where and when they depend on each other.
- Teams can “see” farther out and understanding the cross team relationships to achieve various aims.
- Then throughout these “program iterations”, teams meet regularly to stay in sync or coordinated. 
 
4. **Hybrid Project Management**

- The approaches of project management do not need to be mutually exclusive.
- There are times when aspects or techniques from one method can be incorporated from those of another.
- This blended approach can support those projects that can benefit from elements of the various approaches.
- For instance, teams may want to follow the pre-determined timeboxes of agile teams, yet maintain more traditional long-range planning.
- This enables teams to be aligned in the cadence of other teams while retaining their predictive plans.
